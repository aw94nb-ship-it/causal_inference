# Causal Inference Notes

Welcome to my collection of notes on causal inference! This site documents my learning journey through the fascinating world of causal reasoning, statistical methods, and their applications.

## What is Causal Inference?

Causal inference is the process of determining whether a relationship between two variables is causal rather than merely correlational. It's fundamental to answering questions like:

- Does a new drug treatment actually improve patient outcomes?
- What is the effect of education on income?
- How does a policy change impact the economy?

## Organization

These notes are organized into several sections:

- **Fundamentals**: Core concepts and frameworks for thinking about causality
- **Methods**: Specific statistical and experimental techniques for causal analysis
- **Advanced Topics**: More sophisticated approaches and considerations
- **Resources**: References, datasets, and further reading

## About These Notes

I'm creating these notes as I learn causal inference. They combine:

- Theoretical explanations
- Mathematical formulations
- Code examples in Python
- Real-world applications and case studies

Feel free to explore, and happy learning!
